We encountered a problem while reading the routes from your applications source.
This might happen when there are lazy-loaded routes, that are not loaded,
Or when there are paths we can not resolve statically.
Check the routes in your app, rebuild and retry.
(You can inspect the error by passing the --showGuessError flag

When there are extraRoutes in your config, we will still try to render those.

      Error, missing "<scully-content>" in route "/s/research"
      without <scully-content> we can not render this route.
      Make sure it is in there, and not inside any conditionals (*ngIf)
      You can check this by opening "http://localhost:4200/s/research"
      when you serve your app with ng serve and then in the browsers console run:
      document.querySelector('scully-content')
